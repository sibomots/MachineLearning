# MachineLearning
Machine Learning demo software


## Platforms Supported

This software will build on both Windows and Unix-based systems


## How to Use

After compiling the software, simply run with two arguments.  The arguemnts
are filenames (placed where you choose) that contain the image and
label data from the MNIST data-sets

```
./program  train-images-idx3-ubyte train-labels-idx1-ubyte
```

## How to debug

The programs are mediocre in terms of their error reporting.  
That is an area of improvement.

The source code is by most parts adapted from the lectures given
online from these sources:
